			<p>Native to a few mountain ranges in south central China, Giant Pandas have large distinctive
			black patches around their eyes, over the ears, and across their round body. Though 99% of their
			diet consists of bamboo, they will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in
			the form of birds, rodents or carrion. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other
			development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.</p>
