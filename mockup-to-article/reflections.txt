## Reflection

1. While doing this project I learned how to translate a mockup
 with the help of html. To complete this task I learned various
 html functions for example how to write in italics, the horizontal
 rule, superscript, strikethrough.
2. I found the entire exercise very easy. I did some research and searched the required functions
on internet. HTML element reference was very helpful.
3. I did not find anything difficult worth mentioning.
4. The problem solving strategies from the first project have been extremely
helpful. Now I am well aware that getting stuck is completely normal and there
is no need to panic. I enjoyed doing this project.
